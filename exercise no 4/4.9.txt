4.9 Identify and correct the errors
a)Given code:
while (c <= 5)
{
    product *= c;
    ++C;
}

Error:
Variable C is incremented, but the loop condition uses c.
C++ is case-sensitive, so C and c are different variables.
Correct code:
while (c <= 5)
{
    product *= c;
    ++c;
}
correct program:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int c=1;
	int product;
	while (c <= 5)
{
    product *= c;
    cout<<product;
    ++c;
}
return 0;
}
output:
12624120
b)Given code:
cin << value;
Error:
cin uses the extraction operator (>>), not <<.
Correct code:
cin >> value;
c)Given code:
if (gender == 1)
    cout << "Woman" << endl;
else;
    cout << "Man" << endl;
Error:
There is a semicolon after else, which ends the else statement.
As a result, "Man" is printed every time, regardless of the condition.
Correct code:
if (gender == 1)
    cout << "Woman" << endl;
else
    cout << "Man" << endl;
